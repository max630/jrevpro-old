		jrevpro -g

Interactive mode
================
	Let us assume a file xyz.class in our directory.
	
To decompile,

	jrevpro -i xyz.class
	
(jrevpro)dc 
  ... Decompiles File ...
  
(jrevpro)da
  .. Disassembles file ...
  
(jrevpro)viewpool  |  vp  <cp_index>
  .. Views ConstantPool ....
  
(jrevpro)exit
    ...Exits.
